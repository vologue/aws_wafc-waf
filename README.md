# AWS WAF classic to AWS WAF
- Status : INCOMPLETE

## To Do
- Modularise
	- get data
	- Match rules
	- Unlink resourses from classic waf
	- link resources to new one
	- Delete classic waf
	- Add command line args
	- Run in main
	- Code optimization
## Things I'm not thinking about just yet but might in the future
	- Adding managed rules (cost optimization)
	- pass aws cli 1/2 as command line argument
